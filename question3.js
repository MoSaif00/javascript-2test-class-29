## Question 3:
Create a function, called injectBooksToDOM, that:
      - Takes 1 argument: an array of objects
      - Loops over the array
      - Display the content of each book along with the book image
      - Returns true if it works, false if it doesn't
  
      Target the '#root' element in 'index.html'.
      Use the following object: 
      const books = [
            {
                  bookName: "The Nature of Software Development",
                  author: "Ron Jeffries",
                  coverURL:
                        "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*CQRh-pFTZ97ReXogbefleQ.png"
            },
            {
                  bookName: "Clean Code",
                  author: "Robert Cecil Martin",
                  coverURL:
            }
      ]
